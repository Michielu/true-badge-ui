# True Badge

Goal: Eliminate uncomfortable introductions at meetings and interviews. 

True Badge creates a free, simple platform for everyone to be able to pronounce names the way the individual <i>wants</i> to be called. 

How it works:
1) Create a Badge -- copy your unique personal URL
2) Paste the URL anywhere and anyone with access to it will be able to listen to how <i>you</i> want your name pronounced.

<i>"A personâ€™s name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language."</i> - Dale Carnegie
